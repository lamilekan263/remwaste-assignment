# RemWaste Coding Assignment

## Project Overview

This project is a frontend application built for the RemWaste coding assignment. The application is developed using modern frontend technologies, focusing on performance, maintainability, and scalability.

### Tech Stack

Vite: Used as the build tool for a fast and optimized development experience cause next js is an overkill.

React (with Context API): Utilized for building the UI and managing global state efficiently.

Tailwind CSS: Used for styling to ensure a clean and responsive design.

Axios: Employed for handling HTTP requests and interacting with APIs.

Feature-Based Architecture: Implemented to ensure better code organization and scalability.

## Project Structure

The project follows a feature-based architecture where each feature has its own directory containing components, hooks, and related files. This approach improves maintainability and separation of concerns.


## Key Features

Global State Management: Used Context API to manage and share state across different components cause making use of redux would be an overkill for app like this since it's just a simple app.

Efficient Styling: Leveraged Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, improving development speed and consistency.

API Handling: Utilized Axios for making API requests, ensuring structured and maintainable network calls.

Scalability: Adopted a feature-based architecture to facilitate project scalability and ease of maintenance.
